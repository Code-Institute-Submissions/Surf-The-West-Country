# Surf The West Country - Milestone Project 2#

##Overview##

This project aims to provide information on surf spots for all-level surfers and non-surfers. 
It is primarly based on the beaches of the West Coast of France and the user can find information on surf level, break type, 
parking, beach access etc. 

## UX ##

Target audiences of this project include:

1. Surfers looking for information on new surf spots and receive weekly notification on surf reports.
2. Tourists seeking information on beaches

## Typography ## 

I choose 'Roboto' as the single font for this project as it allows texts and headings to be displayed in a clean and easy to read way. The main goal is to get information across in a minimalist display from which the user will be able to quickly read and identify key pieces of information. 

## Colour Scheme ## 

The colour scheme ranges from tones of dark grey to blue in order to resemble different shades of the ocea in a neutal approach. 

- #263238 
- white
- #1e1e1e
- #3E4551

## Wireframes ##

I used both hand-drawing and wireframe.cc to sketch the layouts I had in mind. 
The main idea was to have Google Maps as the page's 'hero image' to provide visual sense of where each spot is located. 
The cards would be displayed in correlation to the map's north to south spots.

## How to Use? ##

Once you have opened the main page, choose a location to explore more on the West Coast of France. 
The coast runs from north to south and are divided into four main regions. Surfspots are consequently subdivided into each region. 
Each information card displays icons with extra information on water temperature, beach type, parking, off-shore wind and beach access. 
The user can suggest other surf spots via the 'Add a Surfspot' button on the top right hand side of the page.
